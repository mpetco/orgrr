;;; Commentary:

;; Orgrr is a minimalist but complete note-taking system for Emacs. Its
;; intended purpose is the creation and management of a Zettelkasten-like,
;; e.g. many small notes that can easily be linked together. 
;;
;;
;;
;;; News
;;
;;  Version 0.2.1
;;  Added: the buffer *Orgrr Backlinks* closes, when orgrr-show-backlinks 
;;  is invoked while *Orgrr Backlinks* is the active buffer. Fixed handling
;;  of colons in title.
;;  Version 0.2.0
;;  Added support for orgrr-projects
;;
