;;; Commentary:

;; Orgrr is a minimalist but complete note-taking system for Emacs. Its
;; intended purpose is the creation and management of a Zettelkasten-like system,
;; e.g. many small notes that can easily be linked together.
;;
;;
;;
;;; News
;;
;; 0.9 
;; - Optimizations for straight.el; change of orgrr-window-management default
;;
;; 0.8.12
;; - Added orgrr-insert-project, which allows to qickly link to an orgrr-project.
;;
;; 0.8.11
;; - orgrr-info now shows number of org-files considered
