;;; Commentary:

;; orgrr is an almost feature-complete replica of the core functions 
;; of org-roam v1 (insert, find, and show-backlinks) built around 
;; ripgrep (rg), a lot of regex and hashtables. It does recognize 
;; #+roam_alias, and #+roam_tags. A typical note in org-roam v1 and 
;; orgrr starts like this:
;;
;;  #+title:       title of a note
;;  #+roam_alias:  "alias 1" "alias 2"
;;  #+roam_tags:   tag1 tag2 tag3
;;  #+roam_key:    somekey
;;
;; #+roam_key: is not yet incorporated. 
;;
;;
;; This is my first Elisp package, be kind :)
