;;; Commentary:

;; Orgrr is a minimalist but complete note-taking system for Emacs. Its
;; intended purpose is the creation and management of a Zettelkasten-like system,
;; e.g. many small notes that can easily be linked together.
;;
;;
;;
;;; News
;;
;; 0.7.2
;; - Adds the function orgrr-fix-all-links-container
;; 
;; 0.7.1
;; - When moving notes between containers, links are now adjusted.
;;   The function orgrr-fix-all-links-buffer may be used to fix links,
;;   if a file is manually moved between containers.
